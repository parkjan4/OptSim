SIMULATION
----------
* Show results for two arrangements (200 seats)
1. [0 0 0 0 40]
2. [0 37 15 10 8]
Need to show how the business runs
- Distribution of profit*
- Show the average profit curve and its variance curve (mainly to demonstrate that they converge)
- Number of customer arrivals
- Number of abandonments
- Odds of abandonment by customer group size*
- Number of shared occasions by customer group
- Queue length over time
- Maximum waiting time (limited only to customers who are admitted)
*Between arrangement 1 and 2, we will see major differences in profit distribution and odds of abandonment.
*For example, arrangement 1 minimizes abandonment (at least very close to it) but its mean profit is lower than arrangement 2.
*Arrangement 2 has considerably higher odds of abandonment, but the business is more profitable most likely due to less occasions of sharing tables.

TRANSITION TO OPTIMIZATION
---------------------------
1) Need to optimize table arrangement 
2) Need to know how much to scale up the business 
3) Try other seating policies

****************************

OPTIMIZATION
------------
Need to compare baseline VNS vs. golden section VNS:
- Comparison of profit_all distributions (overlay)
- Report optimal table arrangement
- Report optimal number of seats (and therefore how much to scale business)
- Golden section VNS: 
- Comment on any differences in table arrangement and number of seats
- Reach conclusion about which approach is better (higher mean profit)

Need to test another seating policy (reservation)
- Objective: comparison of profit_all distributions (overlay) just using golden section VNS
- Report optimal table arrangement
- Report optimal number of seats (and therefore how much to scale business)
- Comment on any differences in table arrangement and number of seats
- Comment on whether seating policy affects our decision on how much to scale the business
- Odds of abandonments by customer group (compare to the first seating policy)
- And/or number of admitted groups by customer group (compare to the first seating policy)
- Reach conclusion about which seating policy is better (higher mean profit)
