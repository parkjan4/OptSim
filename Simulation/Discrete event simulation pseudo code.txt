Notes by John:
*For now, code without considering queue abandonment

Seating Policy:
- Always look for empty tables first and assign group to that table.
- If none, assign group to a table with lower number of customers already sitting.
- If none, put in the (appropriate) queue.

1. Finish DiscreteEventSimulation.m
- Read in scenario.arrival and pre-sum the columns beforehand for arrival rates.
- Read in scenario.arrangements
- Create a full "Tables" class with scenario.arrangements (this will be updated throughout)
	- {tableID: int (1,2,3...), table_size:int, num_busy_seats:int, assigned_customer:this is a list}
- Create an empty "Customers" class
- Generate Arrival -- first event is by default Arrival
- Event trigger relationships:
	Event Type | Triggered Event |
	------------------------------
	Arrival    | 1. Arrival (abort if t_sampled > T)
		   | 2. Trigger Duration (conditional)
		   | 		[list, Customers, Tables] = SeatingPolicy(customers, Tables, NextEvent.ID, abandonment_list(:,2))
		   | 		If list is empty i.e. no customers were assigned to a table, I know to:
		   | 			1. Create abandonment event
		   |			2. Update EventList
		   | 			3. Update abandonment_list
		   |		Else: I know to:
		   |			1. Iterate over the elements in list (all customers who were able to sit down)
		   | 			2. Truncate EventList by their customerID's
		   | 			3. Truncate abandonment_list by their customerID's
		   | 			4. As many times as there are elements in list:
		   |				Generate Duration =  (1 - 0.5*Shared)*Duration, where Shared==true if the table is shared (can look up using customerID's)
     		   |				Update "Customers" {customerID=last ID+1, time_arrival=Arrival, group_size, dinner_duration=Duration, time_seated=time_arrival, revenue=0}
	Duration   | This means one customer leaves the restaurant:
		   | 1. Extract customerID for which this Duration belongs
		   | 2. Look up in "Tables" for this customerID
		   | 3. Define "Shared"=true if "assigned_group" contains more than one element; else "Shared"=false
		   | 4. Generate revenue = (1 - 0.6*Shared)*U(consum_min, consum_max)*Duration
		   | 5. Update "Customers" "revenue" field
		   | 6. Update "Tables" by: {tableID=constant, table_size=constant, num_busy_seats-=groupsize, assigned_group=remove customerID from list}
		   |
		   | Trigger Duration (conditional)
		   | if queue > 0
		   | 		If we can find a table for the next one(s) in line (see SeatingPolicy.m)
		   | 			... (same thing as #2 above for event type "Arrival") ...
		   | 		Else: 	queue remains the same
		   | Else: 	Do nothing
	Abandonment| If queue > 0: 
		   | 	Certain groups leave (more than one can leave) based on how much they waited
		   | Else:
		   | 	Nothing happens
	End	   | End
