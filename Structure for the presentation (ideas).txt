1. Problem description
- Summarize and paraphrase the provided problem description

2. Simulation
- Description of variables and event list
	Variables and indicators 
	Description of events and their parameters: Arrival, Departure, Abandonment, Finish
	Trigger relationships
- Description of scenario/instance
- Description of seating policies====================================MURAT=========================================
- Describe variance reduction method
	Present the comparison results of regular vs. variance reduction methods
	Present the reduction in computational cost (stopping criteria: at least 100 simulations AND at least 0.01 precision in Std. Dev profit)
- Present simulation plots ==================================CAIO========================================

3. Optimization
- Define the decision variables
- Define the objective function (justify why we maximize mean profit as opposed to worst case profit, certain percentile, etc.)
- Describe neighborhood structure
- Present our baseline model =================================MARTI======================================
- Present our hybrid approach of combined greedy search and {simulated annealing, VNS} methods on the basis of golden section method
	In particular, justify our parameters i.e. argue that our choice of M and K are not in fact too small 
==================================JOHN=======================================
4. Results & discussion
- For each seating policy:
	Present optimal mean profit
	Present optimal interval for number of seats
	Present optimal table arrangement
	Present simulation results (plots)
