Hybrid Greedy Simulated Annealing method:
- Play with different parameters (M, K in particular) to get better mean profit
1. Play around with (smaller) tolerance "l" to get better profits
2. Play around with (larger) M and K to get better profits
*Make sure in each simulated annealing run, the volatility of obj. value towards the end is effectively non-existent.

Baseline method:
1. 100% Greedy approach
2. Variable neighborhood search
