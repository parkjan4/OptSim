- Finding better seating policy (higher profit)
- Experimenting with table neighborhood structure

Computational issue with simulated annealing:
- With l = 20, Golden Section Method requires about 5 iterations => five calls of simulated annealing
- Initialization requires 2 calls of simulated annealing
- One call of simulated annealing = 2*M*K calls of Run_Simulation (about 20 seconds per call)
- In total, 7*2*M*K*20 seconds
